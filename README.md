# Pang-Game
Pang Game Prototype

This Protoype has been build for Comunix by Daniel Mor
Extra credits used on this assignment:

1. Architecture designed with MVC paradigm -->
   Implemented MVC to the project, makes more sense to work from macro to micro.
2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty -->
    There are total of 6 levels, with increasing difficulty, varying by ball amount, ball speed, and placement at each level
3. Two-player, same screen local multiplayer  -->
    decided to add a second player because coop is always fun and adds to the core gameplay.
    Moreover, it was bit challenging setting up the input system for 2 people on one device, without taking too much screen place
4. Custom visuals and shaders -->
    Added graphic art that would fit the gamestyle, however I did not yet add Shaders due to priorities

Decided to disgard the following tasks:
9. Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game -->
    too early to add leaderboard for a prototype
12. Custom soundtracks and SFX -->
    Although I added a sound manager to the game, i could not find music that would fit.. and did not have time to produce one due to time limit
