# Pang-Game
Pang Game Prototype

This Protoype was developed in a couple of days by Daniel Mor

Personal statement:
In order to imporve the existing the prototype there is a need implement modular character structure, to assist adding new character features like different ammo or temporary boost with ease thru the development of the project.

Extra credits used on this assignment:

1. Architecture designed with MVC paradigm -->
   Implemented MVC to the project, makes more sense to work from macro to micro.
2. Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty -->
    There are total of 6 levels, with increasing difficulty, varying by ball amount, ball speed, and placement at each level
3. Two-player, same screen local multiplayer  -->
    decided to add a second player because coop is always fun and adds to the core gameplay.
    Moreover, it was bit challenging setting up the input system for 2 people on one device, without taking too much screen place
4. Custom visuals and shaders -->
    Added graphic art that would fit the gamestyle, however I did not yet add Shaders due to more important priorities

Decided to disgard the following tasks:
1. Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game -->
    too early to add leaderboard for a prototype
2. Custom soundtracks and SFX -->
    Although I added a sound manager to the game, i could not find music that would fit the theme of the game over the time limit.
